# Mintz_CS579_FinalProject
Githhub copy of my final project for MET CS579 Database Management.

## Project overview:
A local ski resort is creating a new database system to oversee their rental shop. This system will be used to track customer information, rental agreements, and equipment inventory for all winter activities including snowboarding, downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, a. The end-user should be able to easily search for past customers and rental contracts, as well as create new entries. As with any kind of rental business, it is crucial that this ski shop has the ability to keep track of all pieces moving in and out of the shop. Staff members should be able to get easy to questions like: How many large sized helmets are available to rent? What percentage of equipment is damaged? Etc.
